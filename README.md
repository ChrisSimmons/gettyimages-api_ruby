# Getty Images Connect SDK 

# Deprecated

As of November 2016, we will no longer be improving or maintaining the language-specific SDKs. The API is still alive and under active feature development. Current documentation can be found at [developers.gettyimages.com/api/docs/](http://developers.gettyimages.com/api/docs/).
SDK source code remains open source, providing a technology example of interaction with the Getty Images API. We will no longer take pull requests for these repositories, but feel free to fork them for your own modifications.

The following describes how to create the local gem package for ConnectSDK. The package will be created in the pkg folder in the source code location. 

	$ cd connect_sdk_ruby/ConnectSDK
	$ bundle exec rake install

## Usage
```ruby
require "ConnectSdk"

api_key = "Connect API Key"
api_secret = "Connect API Secret"

# create instance of the Connect SDK
connectSdk = ConnectSdk.new(api_key, api_secret)
search_results = connectSdk
	.search().images()
	.with_phrase("gorilla")
	.with_page(2)
	.with_page_size(5)
	.execute()
    
search_results["images"].each do | image |
	puts "Id: #{image["id"]} Title: #{image["title"]}" 
end
```
